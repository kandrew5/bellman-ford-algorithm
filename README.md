# bellman-ford-algorithm
Implementation of Bellman-Ford algorithm with C++ using BOOST library 

The purpose of this repository is to implement Bellman-Forst algorithm, from chapter 5 of **R. Ahuja, T. Magnanti, J. Orlin, "Network Flows", Prentice-Hall, 1993** and compare my algorithm with the BOOST's Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
